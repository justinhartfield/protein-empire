CHEESECAKE IMAGE ANALYSIS
=========================

Analyzed images and their ACTUAL content:

1. classic-vanilla-bean-cheesecake.png = BANANA cheesecake (shows banana slices, bananas in background)
   SHOULD BE: banana-cream-cheesecake.png

2. banana-cream-cheesecake.png = BANANA cheesecake (same image as above - duplicate)
   CORRECT MATCH

3. strawberry-swirl-cheesecake.png = STRAWBERRY swirl cheesecake (pink swirls, strawberries on top)
   CORRECT MATCH

4. key-lime-cheesecake.png = KEY LIME cheesecake (green tint, limes in background, lime zest)
   CORRECT MATCH

5. blueberry-swirl-cheesecake.png = BLUEBERRY swirl cheesecake (blueberry swirls, fresh blueberries)
   CORRECT MATCH

PATTERN IDENTIFIED:
- Some images ARE correctly named (strawberry, key-lime, blueberry)
- The issue is that DUPLICATES were created with wrong names
- The duplicate pairs share the same image but have different recipe names

DUPLICATE PAIRS (same image, different names):
- banana-cream-cheesecake.png = classic-vanilla-bean-cheesecake.png (both show BANANA)
- blueberry-swirl-cheesecake.png = no-bake-chocolate-cheesecake.png (both show BLUEBERRY)

The problem: When images were duplicated, they kept the same visual content
but were given names that don't match what they show.

SOLUTION NEEDED:
For each recipe that has a mismatched image, we need to:
1. Find the image that actually matches the recipe name
2. Or generate a new image if no matching image exists


MORE FINDINGS:
- no-bake-chocolate-cheesecake.png = Shows BLUEBERRY cheesecake (same as blueberry-swirl)
  WRONG! Should show chocolate cheesecake
  
- pumpkin-spice-cheesecake.png = Shows CHOCOLATE PEANUT BUTTER cheesecake (layered, with PB cup on top, peanut butter jar in background)
  WRONG! Should show pumpkin/orange colored cheesecake
  
- chocolate-peanut-butter-cheesecake.png = Shows CHOCOLATE PEANUT BUTTER cheesecake (same image)
  CORRECT MATCH

PATTERN CONFIRMED:
The images were duplicated incorrectly. The "correct" image for each type exists,
but it was also copied to wrong filenames.

For example:
- chocolate-peanut-butter-cheesecake.png is CORRECT (shows chocolate PB cheesecake)
- BUT the same image was ALSO saved as pumpkin-spice-cheesecake.png (WRONG)

SOLUTION:
Need to identify which unique image matches which recipe, then:
1. Keep the correctly named version
2. Delete or regenerate the incorrectly named duplicates
