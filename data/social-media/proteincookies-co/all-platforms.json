In this Dairy-Free Peanut Butter Protein Cookies recipe, we use just 60g of protein powder combined with other ingredients that add moisture and texture.\n\nThe result? 12g of protein per serving that actually tastes like real cookies!\n\n📊 Macros:\n• Protein: 12g\n• Calories: 135\n• Carbs: 12g\n• Fat: 7g\n\n🔗 Get the full recipe: https://proteincookies.co/dairy-free-peanut-butter-protein-cookies\n\nClick the link for the full recipe! 🔗"
