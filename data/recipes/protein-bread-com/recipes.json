      "description": "This hearty and healthy whole wheat sandwich bread delivers an impressive 18 grams of protein per slice, making it an ideal choice for fueling your active lifestyle and supporting muscle recovery. Rich in fiber and complex carbs, it provides sustained energy and promotes digestive health, while its soft, chewy texture and warm, nutty flavor make every bite truly satisfying. Perfect for post-workout meals, meal prepping, or a wholesome sandwich boost, this bread keeps well in the fridge and can be sliced fresh for sandwiches, toast, or even breakfast wraps. For those with gluten sensitivities, consider using gluten-free whole wheat alternatives or adding vital wheat gluten to enhance the texture, while vegans can substitute eggs with flaxseed or chia seed egg replacements without sacrificing protein content. To achieve the best rise and a light, airy crumb, ensure your yeast is fresh and proof it properly before mixing. For added flavor, sprinkle some seeds or herbs on top before baking, and store in an airtight container to maintain freshness. Whether enjoyed as a hearty sandwich or toasted with your favorite toppings, this bread offers a nutritious, high-protein foundation for any meal.",
